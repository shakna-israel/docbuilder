# Developers Styleguide

When developing on Docbuilder, maintaining a consistent style is important and helps keep code simple, concise and finally, both useable and readable.

### Variables

When a variable is used, it should be camel case, and be more than one word.

```
stringStripped
```

### Return Values

All functions that return a value should return a dict.

```
return { 'value': True }
```
