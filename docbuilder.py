# # Docbuilder
# *Docbuilder is a small python script that will take another Python program, and turn it into documentation.*
# Docbuilder is a tool for developing *Literate Programs* with Python.
# A literate program combines both Markdown and a programming language. It is traditionally used for scientific purposes.
# ## Why Docbuilder?
# * No need to detangle programs before running them - Python reads the Docbuilder syntax fine. If your code is written correctly, it will run.
# * Generates Markdown instead of generating both Markdown and an executable file.
# * The options for Literate Programming under Python is few and far between.
# * Impressive compatibility. It doesn't really matter what version of Python you are running. Docbuilder will run.

## Notes:
# * Docbuilder will not ask before clobbering your output file. It may even kill the entire directory.
# * Docbuilder has no dependencies.
# * Docbuilder simply converts your comments and code into Markdown.
# * Docbuilder builds Markdown, and is mostly compatible with whatever [Python Markdown](https://pythonhosted.org/Markdown/) can read. But just in case, check the [Issues](https://github.com/shakna-israel/docbuilder/issues).
