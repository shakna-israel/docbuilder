* Docbuilder is a small python script that will take another Python program, and turn it into documentation.
    * This is the [Literate Programming Style](https://github.com/jashkenas/journo)
* Docbuilder is used to generate technical documentation. *It isn't reccomended at this stage for User Documentation.*
* It generates Markdown documents, though it does expect that MKDocs will use it.
